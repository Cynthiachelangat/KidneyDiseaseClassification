## Installation

To use this project, you'll need to have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cynthiachelangat/KidneyDiseaseClassification.git
cd KidneyDiseaseClassification
pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage

To run the classification model:

- Preprocess the data: Load the dataset and apply the necessary preprocessing steps.

- Train the model: Train the model using the prepared data.

- Evaluate the model: Check the model's performance using various evaluation metrics.

Example commands to run the project:

bash

python src/cnnClassifier/train.py --config=config/config.yaml


Model Training
The model is trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify the kidney disease stages. Various parameters and configurations can be set in the config/config.yaml file.

Results
The results of the classification model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices, are documented in the research/trials.ipynb notebook.
